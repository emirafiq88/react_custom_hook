<h1>Lab: Fetch Data Using useFetch</h1> 
<p>In this lab, you will learn how to fetch data in React using a custom hook (UseFetch) and a corresponding component (FetchData). By encapsulating data-fetching logic into reusable hooks, you can improve code maintainability. You will master React's useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and asynchronous operations efficiently. Additionally, you learn to dynamically render fetched data on the UI with JSX, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive components.</p>
